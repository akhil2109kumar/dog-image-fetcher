# Dog Image Fetcher Service

This is a simple application that allows users to fetch random dog images associated with specific breeds. It consists of a Ruby on Rails backend for handling dog creation requests and a DogImageFetcher service for fetching dog images from a Dog API. Additionally, there is a React application for viewing and interacting with the dog images.

## Features

- **Dog Creation:** Users can submit a dog breed, and the application fetches a random dog image associated with that breed using the DogImageFetcher service.

- **Search Dog During Creation:** Users can submit a dog breed, and the application searches for the dog with breed and if it exists in the database then it fetches dog image associated with that breed from the database.

- **Error Handling:** The application gracefully handles errors during the Dog API request and form submission.

- **React Application:** The React application provides a simple form for users to submit a dog breed and view the associated random dog image.
